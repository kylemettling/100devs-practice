// indexOf returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.

// indexOf takes two parameters: searchElement - element to locate, fromIndex (optional) - the index to start the search at. If the index is greater than or equal to the array's length, -1 is returned, which means the array will not be searched.

// 1. Return index

const arr = [2, 3, 1, 2, 3];
console.log(arr.indexOf(3));
