// replace(pattern, replacement) returns a new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. Said pattern can be a string or a Regexp and if it is a string, only the first occurrence will be replaced. The replacement can be a string or a function to be called for each match.
// Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the size of the string
// const p = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. If the dog reacted, was it really lazy?';
// p.replace('dog', 'monkey') => The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy monkey. If the dog reacted, was it really lazy?"
